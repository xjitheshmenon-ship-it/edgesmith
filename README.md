# CPCMS — Configurable Production Cycle Management System
### Edgesmith Tooling India Pvt Ltd

**Standalone webapp** — Node.js (Express) + PostgreSQL backend · React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend.

The backend is a stateless REST API (raw SQL via `pg`, numbered migrations, JWT auth,
RBAC + audit log, in-process background jobs). It replaces the manufacturing module of
Odoo for the Dharmapuri production floor and Faridabad raw-material tracking.

---

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- Health: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health

## Local development (without Docker)

```bash
# Backend (needs a local PostgreSQL on 5432)
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # edit DATABASE_URL / SECRET_KEY
npm run migrate               # apply numbered SQL migrations
npm run seed                  # seed master data, EAT cycle, default users
npm start                     # → http://localhost:8000

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                   # → http://localhost:3000 (proxies /api to :8000)
```

On `npm start` the server also runs migrations + seed automatically, so a fresh
database is ready without separate steps.

## Environment variables

**Backend** (`backend/.env`)

| Var | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` / `production` |
| `PORT` | API port (default 8000) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SECRET_KEY` | JWT signing secret (use a long random value in prod) |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | Token lifetime (default 480 = 8h) |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins |

**Frontend** — `VITE_API_URL` (base URL of the backend; omit to use the dev proxy).

## Production cycle

The EAT cycle is **27 steps** (plus the 16B child-marking sub-step), pre-loaded from
the CPCMS spec, including the four tempering operations on HT90
(Tempering 1, 2, 3, and 4 — Stress Relief). SWAN and OVEN are seeded as placeholders
and configured by Admin via the Cycle Builder. Cycle edits create a new version;
in-progress UIDs keep the version they were created on.

## How to run / update migrations

```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate      # applies any new backend/migrations/*.sql not yet recorded
```

Migrations are tracked in a `schema_migrations` table and applied in filename order,
each in its own transaction. Add new schema changes as `002_*.sql`, `003_*.sql`, etc.

## Deployment

### Render (current test environment)
`render.yaml` provisions a Docker web service + free PostgreSQL. The backend's
`Dockerfile` builds the Node app; migrations and seed run on boot. Health check at
`/api/v1/health`.

### Hetzner / PM2 (future production — see CPCMS Technical Instructions)
`backend/ecosystem.config.js` provides a PM2 cluster config. Deploy steps:
build the frontend (`npm run build` → static files served by nginx), copy the backend,
`npm install --omit=dev`, `npm run migrate`, then `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js`.

## Odoo relationship

MO numbers originate in Odoo and are entered manually for now. The data layer keeps
`mo_number` as a string that maps to Odoo's `sale.order` / `mrp.production`, and every
step completion is logged with workstation + timestamp, so an Odoo sync module can be
added later without restructuring the core tables. No API calls today.

See `docs/api.md` for the full endpoint reference.
